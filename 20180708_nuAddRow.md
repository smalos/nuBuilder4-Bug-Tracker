### Issue: 

I created a form that contains a subform grid. Upon loading the edit screen, I run a script to add some additional rows (eg. 5) to the subform.
But just one row is added, not 5!

The issue only occurs when the the first object in a grid row is a lookup object

### Workaround 1:

If you add a timeout before adding a new row, all rows will be added.

```
var d  = 50;
for (i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
  nuAddRow('accform' );
}, d);
d += 50;
}
```

### Workaround 2:

The adding works well if the lookup is not the first element in the row.
